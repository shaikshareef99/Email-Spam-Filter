Implemented Email Spam Filter using Naive Bayes Machine Learning algorithm.

To train and test the classifier we need spam and ham email data. As data is huge to upload so i have not included here.

If anyone wants to use this code download the spam and ham email data and place them in spam and ham directories respectively. And as i have used corpus='C:\Users\spamfilter' to extract features from the emails stored in the given path, you can give the path where you have stored in your computer.
